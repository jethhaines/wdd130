    <h3>Normal paragraph example</h3>
    <p>
      Austism is a condition that affects the brain and makes communicating 
      and interacting with other people more difficult. The causes of autism 
      is unknown. But genetics, differences in brain anatomy, and toxic 
      subsatnces in the environment are thought to contribute to children 
      developing the condition. 
    </p>
    <h3>Colored paragraph example</h3>
    <p class="colored">
      According to studies, vaccines do not play on the scientific studies. 
      Research used in that study was found to be false, the doctor who was 
      able to write down the research status of this case lost the ability 
      to provide concrete evidences on the particular case of autism. Even 
      with the overwhelmning evidence that vaccines are safe and effective,
      some parents still cannot further the risk of giving Vaccination for
      children with autism. This is extremely risky because vaccine-preventable 
      diseases could get very sick or even die, as could other people around 
      the child. 

      Sometimes, parents notice the medical reaction from their kids to 
      receive mild rash or fever. The risks may be serious if children with 
      autism cannot handle the reaction and not knowledgable to handle risky
      situations.

      The best way for parents with concerns, it's best to seek a clinical 
      advice from a medical doctor.
